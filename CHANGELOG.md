# Changelog

## v2.7 (Build 17)

160 commits since v2.6 — the "reach everything" release: the app now drives
cars, speaks two music-server dialects, plays radio from your own region, and
survives hostile networks without ever inventing an empty library.

### Drive Mode & CarPlay
- **Drive mode**: a big-button full-screen player layout for the car mount —
  enter/exit manually or automatically when a chosen car audio route connects
  (route matching, no new permissions); screen stays awake, dimmed overlay,
  Siri shortcut ("drive mode").
- **CarPlay**: audiobook tabs (Continue / Downloaded / Library), a Podcasts
  tab with the global Up-Next queue, and a Music tab when a music source is
  live; verified in the simulator (podcast chain incl. playback/skip); real
  cars need Apple's CarPlay entitlement.

### Music
- **Playlists**: create, rename, delete; add songs/albums from every context
  menu ("Add to Playlist", with a new-playlist flow); index-precise removal;
  full-size playlist cards with a real cover mosaic (unique per album).
- **Artists**: browse list with portraits, artist pages with top songs; a
  conservative, keyless portrait chain (MusicBrainz → Wikidata → Commons,
  1 req/s, opt-out in settings).
- **Music tab reordered**: playlist cards on top, a grouped library list
  (Artists · Albums · Songs · Playlists · Downloaded), then "Recently
  Played" / "Recently Added" shelves; a paged all-songs Titles list.
- **Continue listening for albums and playlists** — server bookmarks on
  Subsonic (cross-device), local fallback elsewhere; Home "Continue" shows
  music alongside books and episodes.
- **Jellyfin (beta)**: a second music backend behind the same provider
  surface (albums, artists, playlists, search, lyrics, favorites); active
  when it is the only configured music source. Verification against a real
  server is still open — treat it as beta.
- **Booksonic**: a Subsonic source can be declared "audiobooks" — albums
  become books with chapters, progress and continue-listening included.
- **Genres**: a genre browse grid (server genres with counters, curated
  glyphs) as the sixth library entry; each genre opens its albums and a
  paged song list.
- **Top songs** on album/playlist pages (client-side ranking over server
  play counts); **lyrics** in the player (server first, LRCLIB fallback with
  cache and opt-out); shuffle from cards, pages and the whole library.
- **Search**: the music scope now shows Artists · Albums · Songs · Playlists
  sections and offers Albums/Songs/Playlists/Genres category tiles. Note:
  Subsonic matches per entity — searching an artist name lists the artist;
  albums/songs match on their own titles.

### Radio
- **National & regional discovery**: popular stations of your country, plus a
  state/region picker; codec/bitrate variants folded to one station with a
  quality picker on the station page and in the live player.
- **Station detail pages** (context menu, and via a tap on the live player's
  station title): facts (codec/bitrate/country/tags), website, quality
  picker, and similar stations; an ICY now-playing artwork lookup
  (MusicBrainz → Cover Art Archive, station logo as fallback).
- **Region picker curated**: community noise filtered, spelling variants
  merged (queries still hit every raw variant), sorted by station count,
  with a search field and an explicit country choice (your choice beats the
  device locale — no location access).

### Podcasts
- **Listen log**: a per-person listening history that survives unsubscribes
  and feed rotation (own file, tombstones, one-time backfill) — now with a
  **History page** on the Podcasts tab (finished episodes, newest first;
  entries link back while the episode still resolves).
- **Transcripts**: episodes with a `podcast:transcript` tag (SRT/VTT/JSON,
  content-sniffed) get a synced transcript view in the player — live
  highlight, tap to seek.
- **Genre chips** in the podcast search (keyless iTunes genre charts) as a
  browse entry.
- **Text-only episodes** (no audio enclosure) are kept and marked instead of
  hidden — dimmed row, "Text only" badge, tap opens the show notes; they
  never enter queue, downloads, or auto-continue.
- **gpodder hardening**: device registration for stricter servers
  (PodFetch/Pinepods/Nextcloud), and an unreadable server response now
  surfaces as an error instead of silently reading as "0 subscriptions"
  (captive-portal protection; the mass-delete guard stays as second line).
- Feed parsing hardened against the real world: Podsync/`video` enclosures,
  relative URLs, duplicate GUIDs, exotic RFC-2822 dates, broken OPML now
  fails visibly instead of importing a partial list.

### App-wide
- **Full player → source pages**: tap the title/subtitle to jump to the book
  page, show page, or album page (player minimizes, playback continues);
  a context menu adds artist/episode targets.
- **The app restarts on the last selected tab**; a transiently unreachable
  server can no longer throw you off your tab (only a real settings toggle
  moves the selection).
- **Search**: first-open and first-query work moved off the main thread;
  opening the search from a pushed detail page works now (release gate).
- **Full-player bottom row reordered**: Up Next · Bookmarks · Lyrics ·
  Transcript · a "…" menu (Drive Mode, Mark Finished) — and AirPlay solo,
  centered (the Apple position). Navigable titles carry a subtle chevron.
- **One card language**: playlist and music-continue cards share the exact
  Featured-card anatomy (details pill bottom-left, corner button
  bottom-right, tap plays); category tiles flattened app-wide.
- **Silent-error hardening**: broken server answers (captive portals, half
  JSON) now fail over mirrors or surface visibly instead of reading as an
  empty list; a corrupt local subscription store is preserved for recovery
  instead of being silently overwritten.
- Two-level source toggles (tab master + per-source) — a disabled source
  makes zero network calls; large-title loss on tab switch damped
  (iOS 26 framework bug, FB18304716); many small fixes.

### Known open points (honest)
- iPad mini: a slight residual hitch at the bar collapse remains (damped, not
  cured); the profiling trail points at framework layout/text cost per grid
  row — a structural cut is planned (per-tab navigation stacks).
- The large-title damping is an accepted interim solution; the root fix
  arrives with the tab-structure rebuild.
- Jellyfin is beta until verified against a real server.
- The drive-mode hero cover and the reworked cards await the device pass;
  listening statistics are designed but deliberately not in this release.

## v2.6

Internet radio as a fourth media type, global full-page search, color-world
refresh, serverless onboarding, settings reorder + sync history, shared
follow grids, retry parity. (See git history for details.)
